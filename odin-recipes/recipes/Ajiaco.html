        <li>2 chicken breasts (bone-in preferred)</li>
        <li>3 types of potatoes: 3 medium criollas (yellow), 3 pastusas, 3 sabaneras (if not available, just mix starchy + waxy potatoes)</li>
        <li>3 ears of corn, cut in halves</li>
		<li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
		<li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
		<li>1 tsp dried guasca (found in Latin stores)</li>
